The Dependency Inversion Principle states that
high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules,
but both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details;
details should depend on abstractions.
This principle promotes the use of interfaces and abstract classes,
reducing the coupling between different parts of the system and
making it easier to modify or replace components without affecting
the entire system.
