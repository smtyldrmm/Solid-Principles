The Interface Segregation Principle suggests that
a class should not be forced to implement interfaces
it does not use. Instead of creating large,
monolithic interfaces, it's better to have smaller,
specific interfaces. This prevents classes from being burdened with
methods they don't need, promoting a more modular and maintainable codebase.
